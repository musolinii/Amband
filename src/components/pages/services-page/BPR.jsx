                <b>Business process re-engineering</b>(<b>BPR</b>) is a business management strategy,  focusing on the analysis and design of workflows and business processes within an organization. At Amband We aim to help organizations fundamentally rethink how they do their work in order to improve customer service, cut operational costs, and become world-class competitors.

                We seek to help companies radically restructure their organizations by focusing on the ground-up design of their business processes. In Re-engineering We emphasize a holistic focus on business objectives and how processes related to them, encouraging full-scale recreation of processes rather than iterative optimization of sub-processes.
