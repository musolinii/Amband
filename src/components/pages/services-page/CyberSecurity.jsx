              There are two companies in this world, those that know they have been hacked and those that do not.

The growth of cyber crime is largely attributed to its faceless nature (one cannot see the hackers), it is borderless (there are no geographic limitation), growing use of technology in profit, nonprofit organizations, educational institutions and governments.            </p><br />
