            AMBAND has partnered with ARMS RFID to be able to supply their RFID Armory management system. The ARMS Armory Management System is a computerized registry of weapons, gear, ammo, officers, certifications and posts integrated with bar coding and RFID technology for rapid assignments, issues and returns, and supporting security infrastructure to prevent the unauthorized removal of weapons.
          </p><br />
          <p>ARMS was initially developed for the U.S. Department of State for tracking weapons, gear and ammo issued to embassies and agents worldwide, and has been enhanced for the specific requirements of military and police for optimized armory management.</p><br />
          <p>ARMS is mature, robust COTS commercial-off-the-shelf software that has been in continual development since 2007, and is configured for each customer’s exacting requirements. ARMS software can be utilized for warehouses, depots, static armories and mobile armories. ARMS also tracks weapons maintenance events and test firing, inspection and cleaning cycles, and tracks officer qualifications and weapons certifications. ARMS is state-of-the-art technology for managing armories, weapons accountability and weapons security.</p><br />
          <p>ARMS has been implemented for many customer such as U.S. Department of State, U.S. Air Force, Saudi Arabia Ministry of Defense, Royal Bermuda Regiment, Baton Rouge Police Department, Trinidad-Tobago Police Services and other customers worldwide. The ARMS Armory Management System includes support for personnel identification cards, PIN #’s and fingerprints to authenticate personnel that are going to receive custody of weapons, gear and/or ammo from armories or warehouses. The ARMS Armory Management System also supports electronic signatures, PIN #’s or biometrics for validating the transfer-of-custody and chain-of-custody (audit trail records) of all weapons, gear and ammo. Each Issue and Return transaction is saved as an audit trail record, including armory/warehouse, recipient, weapons/gear/ammo received by the recipient, time/date and fingerprint and/or signature.</p>
